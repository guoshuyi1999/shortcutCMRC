          "In the early 1990s US federal agents were investigating Dr. George Zahorian, 
          a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania physician who had been dispensing anabolic steroids and other drugs to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) wrestlers at WWF events. 
          In 1991 Dr. Zahorian was convicted under the US federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which prohibited the prescription of steroids for non-therapeutic purposes. 
          This led to WWF owner Vince McMahon Jr., who admitted to being a steroid user himself, being put on trial on charges of steroid distribution in 1994. 
          The trial concluded with McMahon's acquittal.

          His lawsuit was unsuccessful, 
          partly because he had been using steroids for a decade preceding his WWF debut. 
          Recalling the lawsuit on a 2003 episode of WWE Confidential, 
          he attributed the litigation to his bitterness and claimed that he was an innovator of steroid use in the organization.
          
          Graham went on a public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of steroids 
          Graham went on a public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of steroids 
          during this time, including an appearance with McMahon on The Phil Donahue Show in 1992. 
          During the Donahue taping Graham claimed to have witnessed WWF officials sexually abuse children. 
          During the Donahue taping Graham claimed to have witnessed WWF officials sexually abuse children. 
          
          McMahon claimed the abuse had never taken place, and 
          
          Graham later admitted that he made up the allegations, hoping to extort \"hush money\" out of the WWF. 
          Graham later admitted that he made up the allegations, hoping to extort \"hush money\" out of the WWF. 
          
          In his autobiography, Graham describes making the allegations as being \"my most shameful moment, not only in the wrestling profession, but in my life\".
          Graham wrote an apology to McMahon but received no response until his 2002 liver transplant. Five years after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, 
          Graham was released from his consultancy position in World Wrestling Entertainment.
          He sold his Hall of Fame ring on eBay to help pay for medical bills and requested that he be entirely removed from the Hall of Fame after Abdullah The Butcher was inducted. 
          Graham complained that Abdullah had never wrestled in the promotion. 
          Graham spoke out against Linda McMahon during her 2010 Senate campaign, 
          claiming that she was distancing herself from the racy programming that she profited from while acting as CEO for WWE. Upon learning that his liver condition had worsened, 
          Graham reached out to apologize to the McMahons, even offering to be a spokesman for Linda McMahon's campaign. In July 2015,
          Graham sent a letter to Vince McMahon requesting to take the position of Dusty Rhodes, who had recently died, at NXT. 
          Graham received criticism from fans due to his timing and opportunism. He defended himself, calling his critics \"evil, sub humans\", 
          and compared a possible reconciliation with McMahon to that of long-time WWE critic Bruno Sammartino, 
          who reconciled with McMahon and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013. CANNOTANSWER",
